/========= Description =========/

FONUG is an application designed to generate some random characters to be used in role playing game, fiction or
whatever which needs a character !

You can choose to generate your character entirely randomly or to select the gender, the age or the civilization as start values.

The character is generated according to that choice, the data could not be rational, it's up to you to adjust the values
that you judge appropriated.

The character generated is very general with a view to be adapted to any world background (as a mediavel wolrd to a futuristic one )

There is no server or database, all datas are saved on device.

I will implemente an API in the future, but when ?^^
